# Card for Home Assistant Google Home integration

## Important to know!

It will not be a smooth countdown (It will jump some seconds), but it will always be done at the right time.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Home-Assistant [Google home](https://github.com/leikoilja/ha-google-home) integration installed.


### HACS

Since the integration is under active development, it is not yet added to HACS default repository, only manual installation is available for early testers

To install the integration follow HACS description to add custom repository. Provide `https://github.com/DurgNomis-drol/google_home_timers_card` as repository URL and select the "Lovelace" category. We recommend you select the latest release.

### Manual installation

1. Download [`googletimers-card.js`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DurgNomis-drol/google_home_timers_card/main/googletimers-card.js) and right click and save it.
2. Copy it into the 'www' folder. If 'www' does not exists in your config folder, then just create it.
3. Add it to lovelace by going to `lovelace Dashboards` and then `Resources`.
4. and then input `/local/googletimers-card.js` and change resourcetype to `javascript-module`
5. Restart Home Assistant or clear browser cache.

### YAML installation - Not recommended

Follow step 1 -> 2 above and then add this to your `ui-lovelace.yaml` file.

```yaml
lovelace:
  resources:
    - url: /local/googletimers-card.js
      type: module
```

### Usage

The countdown is done client-side. This means that it will always fire at the correct time.
